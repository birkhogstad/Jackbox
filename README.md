# Jackbox
My first project using Javascript/CSS/HTML

Collection of simple games (tictactoe, 4-in-a-row, 2048, memory)

"jackbox.html" works as a front page with links to all the games

This project is my first experience with Javascript, CSS and HTML. I have spent my time on making the game functional rather than optimalized and easy for others to read, but I hope it is understandable! As in this projject, which just has been something to do with my spare time, I have not taken the time to go back and look for ways to improve the code. All in all, this project has been a great way for me to learn Javascript, CSS and HTML. Enjoy:)
